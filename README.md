# ChainID

This is my first attempt at building a flask app that incorporates ethereum blockchain. The application is built on the Rinkeby test network.

The goal of this was to build a network where users to could register sensitive information that is then stored on a designated smart contract on Rinkeby. Other registered users are then able to request the data and the wallet owner can decide to approve the request. The goal was to give users control over their data and visbility into who is requesting the data. In addition users get paid whenever data is is requested.

This was also my first attempt at writing API's. The API's mirror the primary functionality of app and allow access to the user critical data. But users have to first register before gaining access to teh API. Specs are not yet available yet.
